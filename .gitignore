*.iml
*.iws
*.ipr
/out/ # IntelliJ's default output directory for compiled classes

# Eclipse
.apt_generated/
.classpath
.factorypath
.project
.settings/
.springBeans
.sts4-cache/
/bin/ # Eclipse's default output directory for compiled classes

# NetBeans
/nbproject/private/
/nbbuild/
/dist/
/nbdist/
/.nb-gradle/

# VS Code
.vscode/

### Operating System specific files ###
.DS_Store # Mac OS
Thumbs.db # Windows thumbnails

### Build output directories ###
# Maven default output directory for all modules
/target/

# Common build outputs (if not covered by IDE specific)
/build/
/classes/ # Sometimes created by IDEs or other build tools

### External Libraries (if not managed by Maven) ###
# If 'lib' folder contains manually added JARs, ignore it.
# If Maven manages all dependencies, this might not be strictly needed,
# but it's harmless to keep if you had one in your original project.
/lib/

### Delivery/Deployment related files ###
/livraisons/ # As per your custom delivery folder

### Generated files ###
# If META-INF is generated by a plugin and not part of your source code
/META-INF/

### Log files ###
/logs/

### Sensitive configuration files ###
# IMPORTANT:
# - DO NOT ignore src/main/resources/db.properties or config.properties.
#   These files contain placeholders (${...}) and MUST be committed to the repository.
# - IGNORE the actual filter files that contain sensitive data (passwords, specific URLs).
#   These files should NOT be committed to version control.

# Ignore all .properties files inside the 'filters' directory
/src/main/resources/filters/*.properties

# If you have other sensitive files outside the 'filters' directory, list them explicitly
# For example:
# /src/main/resources/application-prod.properties
# /src/main/resources/secrets.txt

# Do NOT ignore the 'resources' folder itself, as it contains source resources.
# Do NOT ignore the 'filters' folder itself, only its content.
